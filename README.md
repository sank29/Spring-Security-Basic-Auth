# Spring-Security-Basic-Auth
Authentication by basic authentication


This is InMemoryUserDetailsManager authentication. In this authentication we don't have to create user tables to authenticate and authorize user. We have to provide all user information in InMemoryUserDetailsManager. In simple word we have to do hard code user's details in Spring config class.
