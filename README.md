# Spring-Security-Basic-Auth
Authentication by basic authentication


This is InMemoryUserDetailsManager authentication. In this authentication we don't have to create user tables to authenticate and authorize user done in 
InMemoryUserDetailsManager. In simple word hard coded user's details will be there in Spring config class.
